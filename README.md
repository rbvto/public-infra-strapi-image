# Strapi Docker Images

Docker images for running Strapi CMS in development and production environments.

## What is this?

This repository contains Docker images for Strapi:
- **Development image**: For local development with hot-reload and development tools
- **Production image**: Optimized multi-stage build for production deployments

Both images are based on Node.js 22 Alpine and include all necessary dependencies for running Strapi.

## Building

Build images using Docker Compose. The build script downloads the Strapi source code and builds both images:

```bash
./build-strapi-5-image.sh
```

This script will:
1. Download the Strapi release source code to `src/`
2. Build both development and production images
3. Push the images to the registry

You can also build manually:

```bash
export STRAPI_RELEASE=v5.30.0
docker compose build
docker compose push
```

## Available Releases

Images are available with the following tag format:
- `rbvtopudding/public-infra-strapi-image:{VERSION}-dev` (development)
- `rbvtopudding/public-infra-strapi-image:{VERSION}-prd` (production)

To build for a specific Strapi release, set the `STRAPI_RELEASE` environment variable and modify the download URL in `build-strapi-5-image.sh`.

## Usage

The images expose port 1337 by default. Run with:

```bash
docker compose up strapi-dev    # Development
docker compose up strapi-prod   # Production
```
